# FFmpeg Decoder Downmix

This repo supports two build modes for the patched FFmpeg decoder:

## Default mode

The app uses the patched prebuilt AAR in `app/libs/lib-decoder-ffmpeg-release.aar`.

This is the default. No local FFmpeg source tree is required.

## Local development mode

Use the source module `:ffmpeg-decoder-downmix` only when you need to rebuild or modify the patched decoder.

Enable it with one of:

- Gradle property: `-PuseLocalFfmpegDecoder=true`
- Environment variable: `USE_LOCAL_FFMPEG_DECODER=true`
- `local.properties`: `USE_LOCAL_FFMPEG_DECODER=true`

When local development mode is enabled, you must also provide:

- `FFMPEG_SOURCE_DIR`
- `FFMPEG_BUILD_DIR`

These can be set in `local.properties` or environment variables. See `local.example.properties`.

## Typical workflow

1. Build and test normally with the prebuilt AAR.
2. Switch on `USE_LOCAL_FFMPEG_DECODER` only when working on native decoder changes.
3. Rebuild the patched AAR after validating local decoder changes with `:ffmpeg-decoder-downmix:assembleRelease`.
4. Splice only the module AAR's `jni/<abi>/libffmpegJNI.so` files into `app/libs/lib-decoder-ffmpeg-release.aar`
   (recipe: `app/libs/README.md`). Do not replace the whole AAR: its `classes.jar` carries the F5
   `FfmpegAudioRenderer` (`setDeniedTranscodeMimes`), which this module's Java lacks, so the app
   also does not compile against this module in local development mode until that is ported.
